# Conditional-Retrieval-of-Data

Background Story: Let's say an ecommerce site has 3 warehouses, in a particular area. Naming them W1,W2 and W3. Now, an item is supposed to be shipped on a 24th October by W1. W1 gets notified on on 21st October, and checks internally. W1 finds that they only have one quantity of that particular item, and that is defected. Now, W1 reports the ecommerce site, about it. The ecommerce site checks the real time inventory of both W2 and W3 and assigns it to any one of them accordingly. Now there are mulitple locations having more than one warehouses. 

In my project, i have saved data in this format.

W1, W2, W3 | W7, W5, W6 .....
